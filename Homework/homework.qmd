This page contains general instructions for assignments and peer reviews. For specific instructions and templates for individual assignments, click on that assignment listed on the left.

All assignments should be created using Quarto and uploaded to Canvas. Your document should be pleasant for a peer to look at and follow all instructions. Use sections for organization, label figures/tables, and use code chunks.

This is a one-credit pass/fail course intended to help you learn R. The focus is on learning and practice, not on points. Assignments and peer reviews will be graded for completion, but the points are not the point: they are key opportunities to practice R/RStudio/Quarto and to learn from each other. Feel free to work together, discussion questions on Ed Discussion, trade ideas and tips.

## Peer Review

You are required to examine and provide feedback on a peer's homework submission each week. Reading and evaluating others' code gives you the chance to see how other people approached the problems and share how you do things differently. Please give constructive, polite, and insightful comments that encourage your classmate and help them learn from you. Try to mention each of the following: one or more things they did well, one or more tips you have to improve their work, and one or more things you learned from reading their work.

<!-- ## A Note About Rendering Your HTML documents -->

<!-- You need to include `embed-resources: true` in your YAML header in order for your HTML documents to include any plot output when you upload them to Canvas. It should look something like the following: -->

<!-- ![](images/quarto_embed.png) -->

<!-- You can read more about this option [here](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html#rendering) but basically, whenever you render a .qmd file to HTML, all output created goes into a separate, associated folder, which is referenced when displaying the page in your web browser. However, when you upload the HTML file separately from that folder (e.g. to Canvas or through email), it doesn't have the specific output images to reference, so they won't appear. When you specify in your YAML header that you want to embed resources, you're explicitly adding the output created by your code to the HTML file so that a separate output folder is longer created and you can send your HTML file with all its output as one entity. -->
